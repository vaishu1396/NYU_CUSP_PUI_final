# NYU_CUSP_PUI_final
A jupyter notebook of project done for NYU CUSP PUI final exam 


As part of the exam, we answered some basic theoretical questions on data science and machine learning. For the practical exam, we analyzed a problem statement:-

Transportation network models are essential to transportation operations and planning. A simple yet well-designed linear model can provide us insights into the traffic demand. We are going to model the outgoing traffic around LGA, one of the busiest transportation hubs in NYC. In this test, you'll be asked to:

Find possible correlations from observations
Incorporate time patterns using dummy variables
Run and diagnose linear models, in-sample and out-of-sample. Perform feature selection
Cluster the days based on their ridership patterns to see if we can detect any outliers
